# custom-text

A simple plugin that demonstrates a way to replace text.  
So simple, that the plugin.rb file contains nothing but comments!  
And there are only 2 other files in config/locales/  

In fact, the most difficult work will be that of finding the text you want to replace and determining the proper "path" to it.

## Note  

It can not be stressed strongly or often enough, **The yml file should be validated**.  
The server will most likely need to be restarted for the yml to take effect.  
Also, the only way to deactivate the plugin is to uninstall it.  
So it is better suited to more "permanent" changes.  

## Installation

Clone or Unzip the plugin folders into your Discourse plugins directory.

I'm still learning so you are most likely a better coder than I am, but I frequently visit these forums and either I or others should be able to help.
